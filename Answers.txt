What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
Your answer:

Actually there are no functions in Java, just methods. To imitate methods, Java generally
uses static methods.A method is basically a function with one extra parameter (invisible 
in Java). You can refer to it as this. That this thing allows you to access the object 
whose method is being called, so you can think that the entire object is always an implicit
 parameter to a method, additionally to parameters you normally define.

objects can be born (or can be created),
